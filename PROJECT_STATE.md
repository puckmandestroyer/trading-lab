# Project State

## Project goal

Build a Python trading research and demo-trading platform supporting multiple strategies and bot instances.

## Current stage

Stage 4.2 — Minimal Execution Helper (completed).

## Completed

- Initial repository-style project structure and documentation.
- Empty reusable Python packages and a starter Jupyter notebook.
- Initial architecture decision and permanent Codex instructions.
- Codex-assisted workspace inspection and scaffolding.
- Git repository setup, initial commit, and successful publication to GitHub.
- Reusable historical OHLCV loader with backward pagination through the Bybit V5 Public Market Kline API.
- UTC/numeric normalization, explicit duplicate handling, full-period validation, protected snapshot saving, and validated CSV loading.
- First Bybit spot BTCUSDT hourly snapshot saved under `data/raw/BTCUSDT_1h.csv`: 8,760 rows spanning 2025-10-01 00:00 UTC through 2026-09-30 23:00 UTC.
- Validation found zero missing values, duplicates, missing hourly candles, or invalid OHLC/volume rows; download used nine pages and removed zero duplicates.
- Research notebook executed with inspection examples, quality checks, summary statistics, and price/volume plots.
- Thirteen offline tests passed for pagination, normalization, response failures, incomplete coverage, invalid data, and snapshot preservation.
- Stage 2 notebook analysis: simple/log returns, sample return statistics and distribution, trailing 24-hour/7-day hourly-return volatility, volume, extreme movements, and BTC buy-and-hold close-based drawdown.
- All 20 notebook code cells executed successfully using the existing virtual environment, including five plots and checks of the derived calculations.
- The existing 8,760-row raw snapshot remains unchanged; all seven derived columns exist only in notebook memory. No processed dataset, dependencies, or application modules were added.
- Observed hourly mean return: -0.002462%; standard deviation: 0.469127%; minimum/maximum: -4.7946% / +3.9581%. Maximum observed close-based buy-and-hold drawdown: -53.7338%. These describe this snapshot, not predictions or bot performance.
- Stage 3 notebook `notebooks/02_ema_strategy.ipynb`: EMA20/EMA50 long-only crossover events, LONG_ENTRY/LONG_EXIT/HOLD signals, and post-signal flat/long research state.
- All 12 strategy-notebook code cells executed successfully, including full-period and zoomed charts, three event-inspection tables, and signal/state/timing/causal-prefix/raw-preservation checks.
- Original Stage 3 results before cleanup: 79 bullish and 78 bearish crossovers, ending in research state 1. These initialization and state conventions are superseded by Stage 3.1 below.
- Raw OHLCV and existing files remained unchanged during Stage 3. Derived strategy columns stay in notebook memory; no processed dataset, reusable strategy module, dependencies, or trading execution was added.
- Stage 3.1 completed: 50 initialization-only candles, `warmup_complete` eligibility from candle 51, `desired_position` naming, and prior-state gating of LONG_ENTRY/LONG_EXIT signals.
- Current results: 78 bullish and 78 bearish eligible crossovers; 78 valid entries and 77 valid exits. A bearish crossover while flat remains HOLD. Final `desired_position` is 1 (wants long).
- First valid LONG_ENTRY candle: 2025-10-13 02:00 UTC, signal_time 03:00 UTC. First valid LONG_EXIT candle: 2025-10-14 05:00 UTC, signal_time 06:00 UTC.
- All 12 updated notebook code cells ran successfully. Warm-up, previous-state, alternating-event, HOLD-stability, timing, and causal-prefix checks passed; raw CSV and the earlier analytics notebook stayed unchanged. No processed dataset was created.
- Stage 4.1 execution contract recorded in `decisions/002_backtest_execution_contract.md`: completed-candle signals map to the next candle's OPEN, with separate desired/executed state, initial executed state 0, and no execution for final-candle events without a next candle.
- Stage 4.1 documented acceptance cases A–G without implementing execution. All 13 existing market-data tests passed during that milestone.
- Stage 4.2 added the pure function `apply_next_open_execution(candles: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame` in `src/trading_lab/backtest/execution.py`, consuming pre-generated signals without generating strategy decisions.
- Required input columns: `timestamp`, `open`, `signal`. Exact output columns: `timestamp`, `open`, `signal`, `execution_time`, `execution_price`, `executed_position`. Optional input columns are neither required nor copied into the output; input is not modified.
- Execution metadata on signal row N describes its fill at N+1 OPEN. `executed_position` describes state during the row's candle: initial 0, with N's event changing state only on N+1. Valid final-candle events retain their signal with missing execution metadata and no resulting state change; invalid transitions raise `ValueError`, including on the final candle.
- Added 23 synthetic execution tests covering cases A–G, invalid inputs, hourly continuity, input preservation, and edge cases. All 36 tests passed, including the existing 13 market-data tests. Stage 3.1 notebook, raw data, and dependencies remain unchanged. No PnL, trade ledger, or full backtesting engine was added.

## Environment status

- The parent workspace's `.venv/` uses Python 3.9.6. pandas 2.3.3, NumPy 2.0.2, and Matplotlib 3.9.4 were installed for this task. requests and JupyterLab were already available.
- All notebook code cells executed successfully using this virtual environment; the editor's selected kernel was not changed.
- The existing Python/LibreSSL environment emits an urllib3 compatibility warning. Public API calls succeeded; the warning was not suppressed, and interpreter migration is outside this task.
- Git repository root: `/Users/romankondratenko/trading-lab/Trading Lab`.
- Branch: `main`, tracking `origin/main`. Initial commit: `ff57150` (`Initialize Trading Lab project`), pushed successfully to GitHub.
- Remote repository: [puckmandestroyer/trading-lab](https://github.com/puckmandestroyer/trading-lab).

## Current focus

Stage 4.2 implements and tests next-candle-OPEN simulated fill timing and long-only executed state under decision 002. Strategy generation remains in the notebook; PnL, a trade ledger, portfolio simulation, and trading integration are not implemented.

## Not implemented yet

- Transformed datasets and reusable preprocessing workflows.
- Reusable strategy modules and a backtesting engine.
- Reusable strategy-performance analytics and strategy comparison.
- Live/demo execution and exchange integration.
- Multiple autonomous bot instances and order management.
- Centralized risk engine.
- PostgreSQL.
- Dashboards.
- Docker/deployment.

## Next milestone

Proposed Stage 4.3: extract the notebook's EMA20/EMA50 signal logic into a small reusable function under `src/trading_lab/strategies/`, preserving Stage 3.1 warm-up, timing, and desired-state behavior with synthetic tests. Do not start Stage 4.3 until the owner approves it.

No processed dataset or reusable preprocessing module is needed yet. Keep the EMA logic in the notebook until Stage 4.3 is approved. No strategy classes or framework are needed.

## Backtesting execution contract

- The first 50 candles are initialization-only; no events occur in them, and eligibility starts on candle 51.
- Signals use only completed candle data. `signal_time` is the candle opening timestamp plus one hour.
- `desired_position` is research intent: 0 wants flat and 1 wants long. Entries require previous state 0; exits require previous state 1; HOLD preserves state.
- The first model executes a valid event from candle N at candle N+1's OPEN: `execution_time = timestamp[N+1]`, `execution_price = open[N+1]`. Same-candle-close fills are forbidden.
- `signal_time` marks information availability; `execution_time` marks the simulated action. For continuous hourly data they share the same boundary timestamp, while completion and signal availability precede execution conceptually.
- Initial simulated `executed_position = 0`. An executable LONG_ENTRY requires flat state and changes 0 → 1; LONG_EXIT requires long state and changes 1 → 0. HOLD creates no execution and leaves state unchanged. Invalid executed-state transitions must be rejected.
- A final-candle signal can change desired state but cannot execute without a next candle. Do not invent a price or force a terminal entry/exit.
- `executed_position` is now calculated in memory by the backtest helper, independently of `desired_position`. Row N records the state after any prior signal fills at N's OPEN; N's own signal cannot change that row's executed state.
- `execution_time` and `execution_price` are stored on the source signal row, not the receiving candle row. A final row can receive the prior row's fill while its own event remains unexecuted. HOLD has no execution metadata, even when a preceding event changes state at that candle's OPEN.
- No full backtesting engine, PnL, trade ledger, portfolio simulation, or persistence exists yet.
- See `decisions/002_backtest_execution_contract.md` for definitions, causal ordering, and acceptance cases A–G, now covered by synthetic tests.

## Current limitations

The loader supports fixed minute-based Bybit intervals, not daily/weekly/monthly candles. It rejects incomplete periods instead of filling gaps. Requests have a timeout and report failures clearly, but do not retry automatically. Snapshot saving refuses to overwrite existing files. The notebook uses the fixed first-year period and restores CSV dtypes explicitly; no indicators or strategy features are stored in raw data.

Stage 2 volatility uses sample standard deviation (`ddof=1`) of hourly returns over trailing 24/168-observation windows and is not annualized. First-return and rolling-window NaNs are expected warm-up values. Drawdown uses candle closes and excludes intrahour lows; the index is BTC buy-and-hold price analysis, not a bot backtest.

Stage 3.1 keeps `ewm(span=20/50, adjust=False)` with the first close as the seed. The 50-candle warm-up is a research convention, not an EWM mathematical requirement or a guarantee that seed effects have disappeared. No entry is synthesized merely because warm-up ends in a bullish regime; the flat strategy waits for a new bullish crossover. `desired_position` is not an executed position.

The execution helper requires pandas datetime timestamps with continuous one-hour spacing; it preserves timezone semantics and does not sort or fill gaps. It validates allowed signals, state transitions, and finite positive OPEN prices used for fills. Full OHLCV validation remains upstream. It does not enforce a strategy warm-up or read optional `desired_position`/`signal_time` columns; it executes only supplied events.

## Existing files preserved

The existing five Python files in `notebooks/` and four Python files in the top-level `strategies/` are empty placeholders and remain unchanged. The existing misspelled `data/proceseed/` directory is preserved. Use `data/processed/` for new transformed datasets and `src/trading_lab/strategies/` for new reusable strategy code.
